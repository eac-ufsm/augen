# simple_tests

The current folder presents a set of scripts that are meant to be used as testing tools, as well as simple and basic examples of the use of the toolbox.

Currently, the following scripts are available:

-**AmietDataGenerator_test.py:** test the generation of data.
-**AmietDataReader_test.py:** test the reading of data.
-**EasyBeamer_test.py:** test the usage of the EasyBeamer class.
-**SimpleBeamer_test.py:** test the usage of the SimpleBeamer class.

**Special note:** the scripts use the supplies given in the **supplies** folder. The **common_functions.py** script is applied to minimize code duplication between the scripts.
